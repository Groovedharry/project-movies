Project Movies
A multipage React application, that uses the moviedb API to present some popular movies.

Features used
- Hooks, for example: useEffect, useState, useParams and useHistory
- The first page consists of a list of popular movies, and the other shows you the details of the selected movie
- Responsiveness 


The problem
We started this project by making a Trello board just for this, to easier identify what needed to be done. Merging is still pretty new to us, so this has been a good opportunity to continue practicing it. With the help of our team and community we were able to solve issues that arose when working with multiple pages.
